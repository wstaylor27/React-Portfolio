        So, how did I become a software developer? Better question -- why? Two
        years ago, I realized my full-time job at the time needed a change. The
        hours were good, however, the pay was insufficient. My day-to-day
        operation didn't allow me to be creative; there was no spark, no
        passion. I desired change and I wasn't interested in a career of
        mediocrity. I was first introduced to coding through Udemy. It was a
        site that provided courses that covered almost every computer-based
        skill. I dabbled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python 3. Instantly, my
        passion was rekindled. My purpose to create, was now more evident than
        ever.
