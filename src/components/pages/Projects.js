        Greetings world! My name is Wesley Taylor, but most call me "Wes". I was
        born and raised in the "Queen City", also known as, Charlotte, North
        Carolina. As a youth, I was extremely inquisitive of the world around
        me. Everyday was an adventure to explore new experiences. I was also an
        amateur artist. I had a passion to create visual and audio art.
        Fast-forward to present day, I've traveled to over 20 countries! I'm
        also an inventor, entrepreneur, commercial drone pilot, and a music
        producer.
